        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="p1">My name is Mina and it is nice to meet you. I enjoy good conversations, photography, innovation, and engineering. 
          I am always striving for new opportunities and enviroments where I can learn to the fullest. This photography portfolio showcases 
          some of my favourite memories accompanied by photos. I hope you enjoy looking at them as much as I enjoyed taking them. Hope to be 
          working with you soon!   
        </p>

        <p class="p2"> This website was created for #AthenaAward under Hack Club. The Athena Award is a program run by Hack Club for girls and gender minorities looking to get into programming, coding, and building technical projects of any kind. This is the first out of the three projects I am working towards for the Athena Award. </p>
